Cookies and other technologies We use cookies and other technologies as described below to gather information about the users of our Website, in order to know what information is or might be of interest to them. All personal information collected through cookies is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Cookies - Some cookies are managed by us, and others by our service providers, such as when we display advertisements on third parties websites. These cookies are used for a variety of purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, or service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Some cookies enable services that you have specifically asked for, while other cookies are used to remember the choices you made (for example, the size of the font, or the language you prefer) in order to make it easier for you to use our Website when you return.

Other cookies collect information about how users use our Website, for example which pages they visit most often, or how long they stay on a particular page.

Finally, other cookies are used to collect information about your perceived interest in our products so that we can arrange for advertisements regarding these products to display on other sites that you visit on the Internet. This way when you visit other sites that display advertisements, the advertisements that you see are more relevant to you.

When users visit the Website, we may store a number or code in their browsers using one or several cookies to remember their visit. This unique number or code identifies a browser on a specific computer. Browsers may be associated with demographic information, such as gender or age range, based on the other websites that were visited by that browser.

Tags - Our Website site may also use tags (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web beacons), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a webpage.

We use tags to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve Website performance. We also may allow our service providers to use tags to analyze visitor traffic and actions on our Website and to help us understand which pages are more attractive to Users, or which emails have been opened by recipients. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.

If you have any other questions about cookies and other technologies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ or http://networkadvertising.org/ or contact us as indicated in the How to contact us section below.
