Privacy information for California residents If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding your rights with respect to your "personal information" (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (hereinafter the "CCPA") that came into force on January 1st, 2020).

We did not during the preceding 12 months, do not currently, and will not in the future sell or transfer your personal data to third parties (and will never do it without providing a right to opt out).

We may transfer your personal data to third party processors in order to achieve the purposes of the processing listed in Section 3 above, but only with the third-party processors with whom we have a data protection agreement in place. A full list of our third-party processors can be found here.

CCPA provides Californian consumers the following rights (which does not interfere with GDPR): Right to request disclosure of any personal information we collected (Article (1798.100) (a) CCPA). This means in particular that you have the right to request disclosure of the categories of personal information we collected from you, together with the categories of sources from which it was collected, the purpose of the collection, the categories of third parties with whom we shared your personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information that have been collected (Article 1798.110 (a) CCPA).

Right to request deletion of any personal information that we collected from you (Article (1798.105) CCPA). This means that after we have verified your request to delete your personal information, we shall delete it from our records and direct any service providers to delete your personal information from their records, except when Article 1798.105 (d) CCPA is applicable (e.g. in case the personal information is necessary to provide the Services, to detect security incidents, to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality of the App, to engage statistical research in the public interest, or to comply with a legal obligation).

In addition to the possibility to contact us by sending an e-mail to dpo@ada.com, you can exercise any rights under CCPA or request further information regarding your rights by calling us through our hotline.

10. Changes to this policy Any changes we make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on this page, and where appropriate, notified to you by email or notifications via the App. We therefore encourage you to review it from time to time to stay informed of how we are processing your data.
